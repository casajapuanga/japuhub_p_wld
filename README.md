However, following the quarantine, his business had to be closed.
Then, André started as a futures derivatives investor in cryptocurrencies in 2020, and since many projects were launching, he developed the habit of studying them. He noticed that, in addition to reward campaigns, there were many job opportunities, such as moderators or community managers.
Faced with this situation, André began working as a Community Manager, assisting various projects with tasks such as translating articles, customer service, and technical support, including wallet configuration and helping to locate on-chain data and technology-related Blockchain matters.
Recently, André participated in moderating the YouTube and Twitch channels for the Omelete group during CCXP23, the world's largest Geek event.
Just as André has participated in various hackathons and technology events, especially those focused on Blockchain technology:

> josé vieira (José Augusto Vieira de Aquino) - The provided Portuguese text translates to English as follows:
"Graduated in Law from the University of Guarulhos in 1999, he is the head of the law firm Vieira de Aquino Sociedade de Advocacia. Practicing as a lawyer since 2004, he works in the areas of the Third Sector and Cultural Production for 20 years. He has a generalist and traditional lawyer profile, with the purpose of providing ongoing and preventive legal services. Although he works in all areas of law, he holds a specialization in business law, obtained from the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo - PUC/SP with the thesis “THE INFLUENCE OF STAKEHOLDERS IN DECISION MAKING OF JOINT-STOCK COMPANIES” (2007-2009). He is also a musician and composer. He studied piano at the Musical Conservatory of Guarulhos (1980/1993) and spent a long time as an accompanying pianist. From 2000 onwards, he began to develop his music as a scenic element, participating in theatrical performances as a pianist. He has performed as a guest pianist in music venues and concert halls. He is the author of his own compositions, notably award-winning works in competitions in the city of São Paulo. He is a cultural agitator, involved in projects related to the city of São Paulo, such as the Paulistano street carnival, occupation of public spaces and shared management, right to the city, and citizenship. He is the creator and executor of the Alberto Seabra 1128 Project, together with Ritamaria, currently Casa Japuanga, a proposal to use the house, commonly intended for residence and a place of retreat, as a space for coexistence, with the aim of promoting public experiments and experiences through artistic interventions. The use of the house, food, intimacy, freedom of expression, commitment, and stimulation of the senses are elements in this project that allow participants to rethink the relationship between artist and audience, as well as a transformation of values in the worldview. The Alberto Seabra 1128 Project started in 2010 and currently, as Casa Japuanga, is freely identified as an Autonomous Cultural Territory."

Project scope *
What do you hope to accomplish?

JapuHUB: open source community project from IRL to Web3


Objectives:
- To onboard the Community of Casa Japuanga in São Paulo through Worldapp.
- To promote interdisciplinary onboarding meetings through the implementation of the Japu HUB project.
- To use World ID technology for the unique distribution of rewards and circulation of goods and services, without duplication.
- To utilize Web3, such as POAPs and NFTs, for community integration, artistic expression, and decentralized governance.
- To produce a memorial with the meta-structure of onboarding via World ID, based on the recording of the process in dialogue with the community.

Project Design:
- Execution of 4 in-person events of transdisciplinary art, education, and technology over 12 months (1 event per quarter).

The events have an artistic, educational, and transdisciplinary character, addressing the 4 pillars of Web3: authenticity - transparency - decentralization - security, connected with the mission and values of the collective, with the aim of unlocking community access to Web3 in a humanized onboarding process, operating on the difficulties already mapped by the community, and stimulating the use of the World app for purchasing products, artworks, paying for services, room rentals, etc.

At each event, a stage of the onboarding process will be carried out, designed from an initial study of the community and its most urgent demands:
- Event 01 - AUTHENTICITY: Opening event, overview of Web3 with a glossary of terms, presentation of World Coin, Introduction to Zero-Knowledge Base Concepts #ZKP ensuring anonymity with World-Id. Authentication in the World App via Orb. Artistic performance, dinner, networking, and human exchanges.
- Event 02 - TRANSPARENCY: Autonomy and human development - deepening in onboarding and process of forming multipliers, artistic and creative processes, humanized and affective onboarding. Continuation of authentication actions in the World App via Orb. Artistic performance, networking, and human exchanges.
- Event 03 - DECENTRALIZATION: Web3 and community - DAO Chat, roundtable discussions with Web3 community builders and IRL about experiences with governance systems and various community processes. Continuation of authentication actions in the World App via Orb. Artistic performance, networking, and human exchanges.
- Event 04 - SECURITY: Infrastructure and future - DEV Chat, - conversation with experts with deepening and doubts about the technology. General evaluation and dreaming of future steps. Closing party.

The events will be held at 2-month intervals, giving the community the opportunity to interact with the technology and generate their specific demands. It is expected that the most involved community members with the technology can be multipliers of this process.

Technologies to be used:
- √ Authentication - Orb: Register community members in World ID via World App
- √ NFT - Event entry tickets:
- √ POAPs for participation, to be redeemed by participants on the day of the event, ensuring unique distribution without duplication through World ID.
- √ Community token: Adopt $WLD as the community currency, encouraging its use in events and other activities at Casa.

It is also planned to record and edit the audiovisuals of the events, with the aim of generating educational material about Web3 for the community and a memorial of the onboarding process.

Challenges *

- Education for Web3 and onboarding - the community does not have much knowledge about what Web3 is, and there are certain resistances to technology due to a lack of information.
- Digital inclusion and diversity - an issue that concerns diversity and accessibility, from the perspective of Brazil, where many people do not have the technology to access Web3 with navigability.
- Accessibility to language: both to the specific terminology and to English.
- Development of a decentralized governance system that meets the community's needs, built from their IRL experiences.

The provided Portuguese text translates to English as follows:

Casa Japuanga (formerly Project Alberto Seabra 1128) is an experience in developing an intentional urban community, which emerged from the proposal to transform the intimate space of the house, commonly used as a place of residence and retreat, into a place of coexistence, experimentation, and transformation, through transdisciplinary events involving art, gastronomy, and education for the community. This initiative started in 2010 and is currently being applied and developed.

We present the phases that mark its development process:

1st phase [2010 - 2013] - The house - The project: The use of the house as a space for creation and experimentation. The idea of a productive house arises. The house, still as an intimate space, opens its doors to welcome people, ideas, and processes.

2nd phase [2014-2016] - House-project: The consolidation of the project and the use of the house as a territory for its realization. The idea of a collective and productive house emerges. Support from the Ministry of Culture and funding through sponsorship. With the resource, it was possible to exponentially expand the network of relationships and the extended community beyond the residents. The emergence of new collective houses and autonomous spaces is observed, as well as the recognition of existing collective houses or similar projects.

3rd phase [2017-2019] - Consolidation of the house as an urban community and as an autonomous cultural territory: The transformed house is the project itself. At this stage, the Japuanga Collective is created, a group formed by residents, former residents, and frequent visitors of the house, who participate in the co-creation of the space's activities. There are already more than 50 people who have passed through the house and a large network of relationships with collaborators and frequent visitors. A relevant data is the social networks, with more than 1500 followers on Instagram and more than 1500 followers on Facebook.

The House is understood as an Autonomous Cultural Territory, which has a decentralized management, organically structured from the meeting between the skills of the residents and the extended community. Casa Japuanga is part of the Oceano Cultural network, which connects more than 150 autonomous cultural spaces in the city of São Paulo.

4th Phase [2020-2021] - pandemic times
the house closes to the public and intensifies the community process inside. With the support of an emergency law, we managed to maintain the equipment and spaces of the house and conduct some online events. The dialogue with the Oceano Cultural network intensifies, discussing public policies to encourage autonomous spaces and designing collaborative projects for emergency actions and future plans.

5th Phase [2022- 2023] - reopen and flirting with Web3
the house reopens its doors to the public, hosting cultural events. A period of great circulation of residents, from various regions of the country. During this period, we received the current Minister of Indigenous Peoples, Sônia Guajajara, holding the pre-launch of her candidacy for the community of cultural houses and social agents in the region.
2022 - we hosted three events related to the NEAR Blockchain, through the actions of Nomade Label DAO (NEAR Protocol), managing a resource of 1100 USD for a total of 10 artists.

2024 - Web 3 onboarding
2025 - develop Community Dapp [marketplace of products and services]
2026-27 - develop Decentralized Governance Forum on blockchain 

The community's interest in Web3 technology lies in the possibilities of developing decentralized governance that can intensify the already developed processes, generating more community engagement and aiming at the sustainability of the community within the principles of the creative economy.

Our first and greatest challenge is to educate the community for Web3, and the chosen path is the implementation of the JapuHUB project, through the realization of 4 transdisciplinary events of art, technology, and community processes in the house space, distributed over 1 year, attracting artists, enthusiasts, and the community to the affective onboarding process through the worldapp, instituting <WLD> as the community's currency, and using World ID technology as a guarantee of non-duplication of transactions.

Activities developed by current residents and members of the Japuanga community:
artistic performances (dance, experimental music, Brazilian music, law, consulting on cultural projects and community processes, music lessons, training course for pilotage competition, text revision, soundtrack composition, Portuguese-Spanish translation, carbon credit analysis, waste management program, composting, urban permaculture, literary creation, cultural production, audiovisual production, gastronomy and cooking, carpentry, tattooing, bicycle workshop, creativity courses.

A Casa Japuanga (antigo Projeto Alberto Seabra 1128) é uma experiência em desenvolvimento de comunidade intencional urbana, que surgiu da proposta de transformar o espaço íntimo da casa, comumente usado como lugar de moradia e reclusão, num lugar de convivência, experimentação e transformação, a partir de eventos transdisciplinares envolvendo arte, gastronomia e educação para a comunidade. Esta iniciativa surgiu em 2010 e se encontra em aplicação e desenvolvimento. 

Apresentamos as fases que marcam seu processo de desenvolvimento:
> 
1a. fase [2010 - 2013] - A casa - O projeto: O uso da casa como espaço de criação e experimentação. Surge a ideia de casa produtiva. A casa ainda como espaço íntimo abre suas portas para receber e acolher pessoas, ideias e processos.

2a. fase [2014-2016] - Casa-projeto: A consolidação do projeto e o uso da casa como território para sua realização. Surge a ideia de casa coletiva e produtiva. Apoio do Ministério da Cultura e financiamento por patrocínio. Com o recurso, foi possível ampliar exponencialmente a rede de relacionamento e a comunidade expandida para além dos moradores. Observa-se o surgimento de novas casas coletivas e espaços autônomos, assim como se reconhecem casas coletivas ou projetos semelhantes que já existiam anteriormente.
>
3a. fase [2017-2019] - Consolidação da casa como comunidade urbana e como território cultural autônomo: A casa transformada é o próprio projeto. Nessa etapa, é criada a Coletiva Japuanga, grupo formado por moradores, ex-moradores e frequentadores da casa, que participam da co-criação das atividades do espaço. Já são mais de 50 pessoas que passaram pela casa e uma grande rede de relacionamento com colaboradores e frequentadores. Um dado relevante é o das redes sociais, são mais de 1500 seguidores no Instagram e mais de 1500 seguidores no facebook.
>
A Casa se entende como um Território Cultural Autônomo, que possui uma gestão descentralizada, organicamente estruturada a partir do encontro entre as habilidades dos moradores com a comunidade expandida. A Casa Japuanga faz parte da rede Oceano Cultural, que conecta mais de 150 espaços culturais autônomos na cidade de São Paulo.
>
4a. Fase [2020-2021] - pandemic times
